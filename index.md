I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4, part 2
Lab 4 (part 2) was fun to me because I was able to utilize all the information we had learned in class. In this lab part, we had to use if statements, std::cout, and std::cin to create a game where two players play a number guessing game. I do remember encountering some errors when first working on it, but these errors were able to be solved from looking at my notes and referring to past lecture slides. I find that it was most enjoyable because of this, since it is discouraging to be working on the same issue for up to hours whereas in this lab I was able to look at resources to find the answer. Also, after this lab I feel that I was more comfortable with if statements.

Lab 6, part 2
Lab 6 (part 2) was one of my favorite labs because we used code to simulate a blackjack game, something I’m already familiar with. In this lab part, we had to write code to compute the score for a hand (of two cards) of blackjack. Since I fully understood the rules of blackjack, it was clear to me what needed to be written in the code and what was asked of me. My partner and I ran into the most trouble with the functions.cc file, but once we understood how to use if statements to determine the type of card, it was much easier.

Lab 7, part 2
Lab 7 (part 2) was also one of my favorites because of how challenging it was for me. In this lab part, we wrote code to determine if parking was allowed on a street according to posted signs. I spent a lot of time going over the “readme” file and the instructions, but it took a long time for me to understand how I should go about writing the code. When I got some insight from my lab instructors, I was able to begin writing the code and found myself taking pride in my work when I wrote the correct thing. Another reason I really liked this part of lab 7 was that it was useful for many people. Something that tells you whether or not parking is allowed at certain places allows for better planning and saves time for the individual using that service. It made me think about how useful computer science is to the global population.
